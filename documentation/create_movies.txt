Code update - make movies
Integrated curiosity code into go_maze_resizeable.py (options to switch on / off and output the images to directories are at the top), I though it was all added correctly but please check!!!.

The code will call the generate_maze_from_data.py...Using the path viewer it should generate and save images for the maze, dict and maps for each step in different subdirectories.....

Then there is code to generate the movie (generate_maze_movie_from_stills.py all uses OpenCV), it has various options (directories where the files are....) and options to produce a movies with the 1st person maze navigation or all three maps at once or the three maps cascaded...

May be platform and other bugs, but please give it a go.... (It currently encodes with XVID, but might be easier to use H264 in linux)
