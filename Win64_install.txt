Installation instructions (Luke Boorman August 2014):

Pre-install dependencies:

A) Computer Vision code: OpenCV, works with the latest version OpenCV 2.4.9. http://opencv.org/downloads.html
The code uses the older cv c libraries rather than the newer cv2, but these are included inside cv2.
Extract and copy the cv2.pyd from: \opencv\build\python\2.7\x64\cv2.pyd to: \Anaconda\Lib\site-packages\cv2.pyd
I altered the code in SURFExtractor.py to use import cv2.cv as cv in place of (comment this line out): import cv

B) Fast library approximate nearest negighbours: flann, works with 1.8.4 http://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann/
32bit windows: cmake select python and c libraries options, then build, will install to c:\program files (x86)\flann move built lib files to location in setup.py and run using cmd console: python setup.py install
test in python with: import pyflann
Windows 64bit: Using Micrsoft Visual studio 2012 x64 with cmake will not work cmake -> select python and c libraries (Matlab not needed here) open \flann-1.8.4-src\src\cpp\flann\util\serialization.h Add in new code at line 94, below BASIC_TYPE_SERIALIZER(bool);
ifdef _MSC_VER
BASIC_TYPE_SERIALIZER(unsigned __int64);
endif
Run the compiler with 'release', this should install files to c:\program files\flann, but will fail on install to python!
The setup.py at C:\Program Files\flann\share\flann\python\setup.py will have the incorrect path to the folder with all the files built using visual studio. I moved the files into this directory e.g. from \flann-1.8.4-src\build\lib\Release to \flann-1.8.4-src\build\lib
run a cmd console goto the setup.py dir (C:\Program Files\flann\share\flann\python\setup.py) and run: python setup.py install
This should run without errors!!!!
test in python by typing import pyflann
error saying cannot load dll will show something has gone wrong (e.g. dll not found or 32bit!)

For python in Anaconda I switched off inline plotting

Should now run....
